# 🎰 Blackjack Monte Carlo Simulation

This project implements a **Monte Carlo simulation of Blackjack** to compare different playing strategies.
It was developed as part of a **university programming and simulation project**.

The goal is to evaluate how simple heuristics perform compared to a simplified version of **Blackjack Basic Strategy**.

---

## 📌 Features
- Complete Blackjack game engine (player vs dealer)
- Infinite deck (sampling with replacement)
- Multiple strategies implemented
- Monte Carlo simulation with configurable number of games
- Statistical evaluation of results
- Visual analysis using diagrams and histograms

---

## 🧠 Implemented Strategies
- **RandomPolicy** – Player randomly decides to hit or stand  
- **ThresholdPolicy (17)** – Player hits until total ≥ 17  
- **ThresholdPolicy (16)** – Player hits until total ≥ 16  
- **BasicStrategyPolicy** – Simplified Blackjack Basic Strategy (no splits, no double down)

---

## ⚙️ Rules & Assumptions
- Infinite deck (no card counting)
- Dealer stands on soft 17 (S17)
- Blackjack payout: 3:2
- Fixed bet per round
- No splits, no double down, no surrender

## ▶️ How to Run

## 1️⃣ Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
python diagram.py
python histogram.py
```**📊 Results & Visualizations**

### Strategy Outcome Rates
![Outcome Rates](plots/diagram_outcome_rates.png)

### Average Profit per Game
![Average Profit](plots/diagram_average_profit.png)

The diagrams show that:
- Random strategies perform worst
- Threshold strategies improve results slightly
- The Basic Strategy significantly reduces losses

---

**📈 Monte Carlo Method**

Monte Carlo simulation is used to approximate expected outcomes by simulating a large number of independent games.

---

**📝 Conclusion**

The simulation demonstrates that:
- Simple heuristics already outperform random play
- A structured rule-based strategy (Basic Strategy) performs best
